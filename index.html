        <p class="geist-mono-text">
          When people think about creative work, they usually focus on the big
          things — the layout, the colors, the typography. But what most
          beginners overlook is that micro-interactions and animation carry just
          as much weight, and sometimes even more. They’re the subtle signals
          that guide users, create emotional connection, and bring a sense of
          life into a design. A simple hover shift, a smooth fade, the timing of
          a reveal — these details tell the user how to feel and how to move
          through the experience.

      <div>
        <span class="geist-heading">WHY IT MATTERS</span>
        <p class="geist-mono-text">
          What I always try to explain is that micro-interactions aren’t
          decoration. They’re communication. They help users understand what’s
          interactive, what’s important, and what’s happening behind the scenes.
          When done well, they make the interface feel intuitive without the
          user even realizing why. When done poorly, the entire experience feels
          rigid and uninviting, no matter how good the visual design is.

      <div>
        <span class="geist-heading">PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</span>
        <p class="geist-mono-text">
          This is also one of the big things that influences my own creative
          direction. The people I admire aren’t just good at layouts — they use
          movement with intention. Their transitions feel confident, their
          interactions feel thoughtful, and their animations carry emotion.
          Watching their work taught me that animation is more than motion; it’s
          storytelling. It’s taste. It’s decision-making. And those choices are
          what separate forgettable work from experiences that actually stay
          with you.

      <div>
        <span class="geist-heading">CONCLUSION</span>
        <p class="geist-mono-text">
          For me, studying micro-interactions has forced me to raise my
          standards. It pushes me to think about the feel of a project, not just
          the look. It’s shaping me into someone who doesn’t just design screens
          but builds experiences — someone who wants every moment, even the
          smallest ones, to reflect clarity, control, and personality.
